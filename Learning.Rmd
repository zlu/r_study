## Looking for Help
### ? and help()
- `?mean`          # Shows documentation for the mean function
- `help(mean)`     # Same thing

Example:
`?dplyr::filter`

### ?? and help.search()
- `??"linear regression"`
- `help.search("linear regression")`
This is useful if you donâ€™t know the exact function name. But it doesn't always
work as one might expect.

### Example command
- `example(rename)` # Shows examples of how to use the function

### View Function Source Code
dplyr::filter  # Just type the function name without parentheses
